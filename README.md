# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project is to learn the ways of coding. I built this project to be a study guide for future coding students after I graduate. This will solve the problem coding students face as some of the work can be confusing at first. I learned many useful tools like Visual Studio Code and GitBash which I will use in future projects.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
