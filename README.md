# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project is to learn the ways of coding. I built this project to be a study guide for future coding students after I graduate. This will solve the problem coding students face as some of the work can be confusing at first. I learned many useful tools like Visual Studio Code and GitBash which I will use in future projects.
